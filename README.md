 A calculator to calculate tips 

This project inspired by: https://codepen.io/cphemm/pen/reNwWd

In this project I created a calculator to calculate the tip amount for a meal at a restaurant. There are three inputs to receive information about the meal: the total bill, the percentage of the bill that the user chooses to calculate the tip amount, and the amount of people that are sharing the total cost plus tip. I also wrote my own regex to test the input for the bill. The regex to test for the amount of people I found on StackOverflow. All other html, css and javascript is original.
